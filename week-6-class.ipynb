    "The advertising company \"Greedy Oligarchs & Other Grubby Lowdown Evildoers\" has $n$ clients and wants to maximise their revenues before their initial public offering in $T$ days. They decide to concentrate each day on a single advertising campaign for a single client. For example, on day 1 they might advertise for client 3, on day 2 for client 7 and day 3 back to client 3 again. Some clients are bigger than others and so make more money, but repeatedly advertising for the same clients has diminishing returns. The first day of advertising for client $i$ they will make $c_i$. The second day of advertising for the same client, $c_i/2$, the third day $c_i/4$ and so on, at day $k$ for client $i$ they will make $c_i/2^k$, so it might make sense for them to advertise one day with one client, and then another day with another client, and so on.\n",
